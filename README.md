# Micah Thompkins Personal Website

I decided to build this personal portfolio website to serve as a portfolio of projects, practice coding skills, and showcase personal projects I make and have made.

### Technologies
* React JS 17
* HTML5
* CSS
* Python 3
* Flask

On the front end this website uses CSS, HTML, and React. Originally I used vanilla Javascript but I wanted more practice with React, so I recently rebuilt the projects page to be a React app. The scanner project runs in React and then communciates with a Flask web server running my Python scanner code.

### Status
Project is live and can be seen at https://www.micahthompkins.com

### Pages
###### Home/Index
The root page for my website, contains links to other major pages and my name.

###### About Me 
A page that has a photo of me and a short biography about who I am

###### Contact me
This page contains links to my github, LinkedIn, and my email.

###### Projects
This page is a React App that contains information about all my projects. As well as a interactive for my scanner project.

###### Resume
This page contains my resume.


### Upcoming Additions
I am beginning work on taking my Go project that runs locally and making it work as a game in browser. Additionally I am going to create a photo experience on my website for my final project for two classes.
