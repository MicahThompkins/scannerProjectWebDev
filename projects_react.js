The year before we had all taken a class on Android development so we had learned the basics of mobile development and Android Development.  As a member of the iOS team I had to teach myself Swift in order to be able to develop for iOS as part of this project. ", "Throughout the course of the year we used principles from Agile development to produce features by deadlines. We met with our client, the board of education multiple times to present, and sent out surveys to parents, students and teachers about what features they wanted. We also formed a group of Alpha testers to test our app through various stages and give us feedback. As we continued to work we next released a semi-open beta, taking in feedback to figure out what features worked well and what didnâ€™t and improving upon our design. Finally at the end of the year we held an open launch party for our app and presented on the process. ", "I was a developer on the iOS team and the Documentation Lead. I worked to add data persistence across the app about which schools people needed to receive information from as well as created the calendar interface, among many other little tweaks.

We built the entire project from scratch, first starting with the point and stone objects before growing the project to the boards objects, the rule checker, the game referee, and finally the tournament administrator. Throughout the quarter we gave multiple code walks to our class explaining and defending our code choice to the professor and our fellow students. Our final project had a visual component, as well as the ability to run a tournament comprised of local and remote players. We presented our final project to our professor giving one last final code walk discussing the entire breadth of our project.", "In this project I learned a lot about modular code design and the importance and effectiveness of Unit testing. Because this was a project that started small and grew rather large we had to design our code in a very modular and scalable way with frequent testing in order to ensure all the moving pieces worked together well. Additionally as an added challenge our professors had us switch partners half way through, as part of this process we had to decide which code base to use, and what elements we wanted to take from the other unchosen base.
